# Homework 1

# 

Problem .01:

``` r
# -create a public GitHub repo + local R Project; we suggest naming this repo / directory   
#  p8105_hw1_YOURUNI
# -create a single .Rmd file named p8105_hw1_YOURUNI.Rmd that renders to github_document
# -submit a link to your repo via Courseworks
```

# 

Problem .02:

``` r
# This “problem” focuses on correct styling for your solutions to Problems 1 and 2. We will look for:
# 
# -meaningful variable / object names
# -readable code (one command per line; adequate whitespace and indentation; etc)
# -clearly-written text to explain code and results
# -a lack of superfluous code (no unused variables are defined; no extra library calls; etc)
```

# 

Problem 1:

``` r
#First, load the tidyverse package:

library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
# Next, create a data frame comprised of:
# 
# -a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
# -a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
# -a character vector of length 10
# -a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

p1_df = tibble(
  rand = rnorm(10, mean=0, sd=1),
  gt_zero = rand > 0,
  char = c("a","b","c","d","e",
           "f","g","h","i","j"),
  fact = factor(c("one","two","three","one","two",
                  "three","one","two","three","one"))
)
```

``` r
#Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and what doesn't?

rand_mean = mean(pull(p1_df, rand))
log_mean = mean(pull(p1_df, gt_zero))
char_mean = mean(pull(p1_df, char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p1_df, char)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

``` r
fact_mean = mean(pull(p1_df, fact))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p1_df, fact)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

``` r
rand_mean
```

    ## [1] -0.5794533

``` r
log_mean
```

    ## [1] 0.3

    ## [1] NA

``` r

    ## [1] NA

The mean of the random number from the standard normal distribution is
-0.5794533. The mean of the logical vector indicating whether numbers
are greater than zero is 0.3.

The mean for the character and factor variables was not estimated. This
is because you can’t take a mean when a variable is not numeric (note
that the logical vector is represented as 0=FALSE and 1=TRUE).

This code converts the logical vector to 0 and 1 (representing FALSE and
TRUE, respectively). It does not convert the character variable to a
number, confirming the prior result (i.e., you can not take a mean when
something is not a number). However, it does convert the factor to a
numeric variable using the numbers 1, 2, and 3. The order assigned to
these variables is alphabetical (i.e., “one” = 1, “two” = 3, and “three”
= 2). This shows that you need to be careful that the appropriate
numeric values are assigned if you do have an ordered factor and it is
not coded in alphabetical order.

``` r
#In a second code chunk:
#-convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result

Problem 2:

``` r
#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

``` r
# Write a short description of the penguins dataset (not the penguins_raw dataset) using inline R code, including:
# 
# -the data in this dataset, including names / values of important variables
# -the size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol)
# -the mean flipper length

mean_flip <- mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm=TRUE)
```

The dataset “penguins” includes 8 variables and 344 observations.
Specific variable names are species, island, bill\_length\_mm,
bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g, and sex.

species is a

The mean flipper length in millimeters is 200.92.

``` r
# Make a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x); color points using the species variable (adding color = ... inside of aes in your ggplot code should help).

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
